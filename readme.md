# Data Structure and Algorithm

In this repository, I have uploaded a bunch of code on DS and Algorithm which I've completed at my university. I have implemented all code using Python and C++. 

* Data Structure
    * [Array List] (https://tutspack.com/category/ds-and-algorithm/)
    * Link List (https://tutspack.com/how-to-implement-singly-link-list-using-c-with-examples/)
    * Stack 
    * Queue
    * Tree

* Algorithms
    * Bubble Sort
    * Quick Sort
    * Merge Sort
    * Insertion Sort
